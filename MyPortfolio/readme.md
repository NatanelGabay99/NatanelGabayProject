# My Name
Natanel Gabay

Hello! I'm Natanel Gabay, the creator of this project. As a passionate developer and enthusiast about innovation, I constantly strive to bring ideas to life through code. Even though I do not hold a background in developement, I still bring a unique perspective to my projects, always seeking to push boundaries and explore new possibilities.

The project you're exploring is a culmination of my creativity, dedication, and technical expertise. Here's an overview:

Project title: My Portfolio

The purpose of this project was to present my skillset as a newly Full-Stack developer. I acquired and still am acquiring new techniques, work methods and the knowledge and understanding of the developement world.

The technologies used in this project are: HTML 5, CSS, a small amount of Bootstrap 5 and a bit of JavaScript (for the hamburger menu displayed in the responsivity mode as you will see in the project).

In the Hero section of the project I added special animation effects to make it look cool, experiencing and unique. In the Project section you will witness a variety of cards that I've created, so when you hover over them, they zoom out and create an effect. This project is fully responsive when touching mobile mode, looking neat, steady and easy to use.

* In order to view the website, go to folder name: "My Portfolio" --> index.html --> open with live server.


How to use:
1) In the Home section you will see a navbar, when clicking each section in the navbar, the page will smoothly scroll down to its section.

2) In the Project section there are multiple sections with cards, each containing a landing page and a JS project. In order to see those landing pages and projects, I've created a button to view them. Once you have entered the presentation page, you will see two buttons on top of the project - One for Download and one for view only.
On a single click on these buttons, each button will perform its task perfectly. You are welcome to try in on your own. (:

In the future, I aim to focus on enhancing the overall user experience of the project. This includes refining the user interface, improving navigation flows, and implementing interactive elements to make the platform more engaging and intuitive. As mobile usage continues to rise, I envision optimizing the application for mobile devices to ensure seamless access and usability across different screen sizes and devices. This will involve implementing responsive design principles and optimizing performance for mobile platforms.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my website! I hope you find it inspiring and useful, Have a nice day.
